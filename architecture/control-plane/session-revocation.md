# DCM Data Model — Session Token Revocation

> **Implements contracts defined in UDLM**:
> [udlm/governance/auth-providers.md](https://github.com/croadfeldt/udlm/blob/main/governance/auth-providers.md).
> UDLM defines the Auth Provider model and authenticated-session contract. This document
> extends that model with the explicit session-token revocation lifecycle, triggers, and
> the Session Revocation Registry that UDLM leaves unspecified.

> **This document maps to: DATA + POLICY**
>
> A session is a Data artifact with a UUID, lifecycle state, and audit trail. Session revocation is a Policy concern — it fires on triggers defined here and enforced by the Auth Provider and Ingress layer. This document extends the Auth Provider model (doc 19) with the explicit revocation lifecycle that was previously unspecified.
>
> **Relationship to credential revocation:** CPX-006 (doc 31) governs credential revocation — when an actor is deprovisioned, all credentials issued to that actor are revoked. This document governs the complementary concern: active *session tokens* must also be invalidated on the same trigger. Credential revocation and session revocation are parallel processes that both fire on actor deprovisioning.

## 1. What a Session Is

A DCM session represents an authenticated actor's active interaction context. It is created when an actor successfully authenticates through an Auth Provider and is destroyed (or expires) when the session ends.

```yaml
session_record:
  session_uuid: <uuid>
  actor_uuid: <uuid>
  auth_provider_uuid: <uuid>           # which provider issued the session
  auth_method: oidc | ldap | api_key | mtls | built_in
  mfa_verified: <bool>                 # whether per-session MFA was completed
  step_up_verified_at: <ISO 8601 | null>  # last step-up MFA completion
  
  created_at: <ISO 8601>
  last_active_at: <ISO 8601>
  expires_at: <ISO 8601>               # absolute expiry (from token_ttl)
  
  refresh_token_uuid: <uuid | null>    # if refresh_enabled: true
  refresh_expires_at: <ISO 8601 | null>
  
  status: active | refreshing | revoked | expired
  revocation_reason: <string | null>
  revoked_at: <ISO 8601 | null>
  revoked_by: <actor_uuid | system | null>
  
  # Provenance
  client_ip: <IP | null>
  user_agent: <string | null>
  tenant_uuid: <uuid | null>
  
  # Concurrent session position
  session_sequence: <int>              # 1 = oldest active session for this actor
```

### 1.1 Session Store

Active sessions are maintained in a **Session Store** — a fast-queryable, low-latency store separate from the Realized State Store. The Session Store is not GitOps-backed; it is operational state that does not need version history.

```yaml
session_store:
  implementation: redis | postgres | in_memory   # profile-governed
  ttl_enforcement: hard                          # sessions expire at expires_at regardless
  revocation_index: true                         # fast lookup by session_uuid for revocation
  actor_index: true                              # fast lookup by actor_uuid for bulk revocation
```

**Profile-governed defaults:**

| Profile | Store | Session TTL | Refresh TTL | Max concurrent |
|---------|-------|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| `minimal` | in_memory or sqlite | PT8H | P7D | unlimited |
| `dev` | redis or postgres | PT4H | P3D | 10 |
| `standard` | redis or postgres | PT1H | P1D | 5 |
| `prod` | redis or postgres | PT30M | PT8H | 3 |
| `fsi` | redis or postgres | PT15M | PT1H | 2 |
| `sovereign` | redis or postgres (HSM-backed) | PT15M | PT30M | 1 |

---

## 2. Revocation Triggers

Session revocation invalidates a session immediately — regardless of its remaining TTL. The following triggers cause revocation:

| Trigger | Scope | Who initiates | Behavior |
|---------|-------|--------------|---------|
| `actor_logout` | Single session | Actor (self) | Immediate; that session only |
| `actor_logout_all` | All sessions for actor | Actor (self) | Immediate; all active sessions for this actor |
| `actor_deprovisioned` | All sessions for actor | SCIM / Platform admin | Immediate; fires before deprovisioning acknowledged |
| `actor_suspended` | All sessions for actor | Platform admin | Immediate |
| `security_event` | Specified sessions or all | Platform admin / security automation | Immediate; emergency channel notification |
| `concurrent_limit_exceeded` | Oldest session(s) | System | Oldest session revoked when new session created beyond limit |
| `auth_provider_deregistered` | All sessions from that provider | Platform admin | Immediate; actors must re-authenticate via another provider |
| `credential_compromised` | All sessions for actor | Security automation | Immediate; correlates with CPX emergency rotation |
| `admin_forced_logout` | Specified session(s) | Platform admin | Immediate |

## 3. Revocation Lifecycle

### 3.1 Standard Revocation

```
Revocation trigger fires
  │
  ▼ Session record status → revoked
  │   revoked_at, revocation_reason, revoked_by written
  │
  ▼ Refresh token invalidated (if exists)
  │   Cannot be exchanged; refresh endpoint returns 401
  │
  ▼ Session UUID added to Session Revocation Registry
  │   (fast-queryable; all DCM components check this on every request)
  │
  ▼ Revocation event published to Message Bus
  │   event_type: auth.session_revoked
  │   session_uuid, actor_uuid, revocation_trigger, revoked_at
  │
  ▼ Audit record written
      session_uuid, actor_uuid, revocation_trigger, revoked_by, revoked_at
```

### 3.2 Actor Deprovisioning Revocation (parallel with CPX-006)

Actor deprovisioning fires both credential revocation (CPX-006) and session revocation simultaneously. Neither blocks the other; both must complete before the deprovisioning is acknowledged.

```
Actor deprovisioning initiated
  │
  ├──→ Credential revocation (CPX-006)
  │     All credentials issued to actor_uuid → revoked
  │     Credential Revocation Registry updated
  │
  └──→ Session revocation (this document)
        All active sessions for actor_uuid → revoked
        Session Revocation Registry updated
        auth.session_revoked events published per session
  │
  ▼ Both complete → deprovisioning acknowledged
    actor_deprovisioned event published
    Audit record for deprovisioning written
```

### 3.3 Emergency Revocation (Security Event)

Security events bypass the standard pipeline. Revocation is immediate with no grace period.

```
Security event detected
  │
  ▼ Target sessions determined
  │   (single session, all sessions for actor, or all sessions from a provider)
  │
  ▼ Sessions → revoked immediately
  │   Session Revocation Registry updated within SLA:
  │     standard/prod: PT30S
  │     fsi: PT10S
  │     sovereign: PT5S
  │
  ▼ auth.security_session_revoked event published (critical urgency)
  │   Routed to security team via configured notification service
  │
  ▼ Platform admin notified regardless of profile
  │
  ▼ All in-flight requests from these sessions → 401 Unauthorized
```

---

## 4. Session Revocation Registry

The Session Revocation Registry is the authoritative list of revoked-but-not-yet-expired session UUIDs. Every DCM component that accepts bearer tokens must check this registry on each request.

```yaml
session_revocation_registry:
  # Session UUID → revocation record
  # Fast in-memory cache with TTL equal to original session TTL
  # After the original session TTL would have expired, the entry is
  # removed (the session would have been invalid anyway)
  
  entry:
    session_uuid: <uuid>
    revoked_at: <ISO 8601>
    original_expires_at: <ISO 8601>    # entry removed after this time
    revocation_trigger: <string>
```

**Cache refresh behavior by profile:**

| Profile | Max cache age | Behavior on cache miss |
|---------|--------------|----------------------|
| `minimal` | PT5M | Check authoritative store; cache result |
| `standard` | PT1M | Check authoritative store; cache result |
| `prod` | PT30S | Check authoritative store; cache result |
| `fsi` | PT10S | Check authoritative store; cache result |
| `sovereign` | PT5S | No cache — always check authoritative store |

---

## 5. Token Introspection

DCM's Ingress layer exposes a token introspection endpoint for internal components and external systems that need to validate a token without maintaining their own cache:

```
POST /api/v1/auth:introspect

Authorization: Bearer <api-key-with-introspection-scope>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "token": "<bearer-token-to-check>"
}

Response 200 (active session):
{
  "active": true,
  "session_uuid": "<uuid>",
  "actor_uuid": "<uuid>",
  "expires_at": "<ISO 8601>",
  "mfa_verified": true,
  "tenant_uuid": "<uuid | null>",
  "roles": ["consumer"],
  "scopes": ["read", "write"]
}

Response 200 (revoked or expired):
{
  "active": false,
  "reason": "revoked | expired | not_found"
}
```

Session tokens use JWT format (RFC 7519). This introspection endpoint follows [RFC 7662 (OAuth 2.0 Token Introspection)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7662).

---

## 6. Consumer API — Session Management Endpoints

### 6.1 Logout (Single Session)

```
DELETE /api/v1/auth/session

Response 204 No Content
```

Revokes the session corresponding to the bearer token in the `Authorization` header. No body required.

### 6.2 Logout All Sessions

```
DELETE /api/v1/auth/sessions

Response 204 No Content
```

Revokes all active sessions for the authenticated actor.

### 6.3 List Active Sessions

```
GET /api/v1/auth/sessions

Response 200:
{
  "items": [
    {
      "session_uuid": "<uuid>",
      "created_at": "<ISO 8601>",
      "last_active_at": "<ISO 8601>",
      "expires_at": "<ISO 8601>",
      "auth_method": "oidc",
      "client_ip": "<IP | null>",
      "current": true    // true for the session making this request
    }
  ],
  "total": 2
}
```

### 6.4 Revoke Specific Session

```
DELETE /api/v1/auth/sessions/{session_uuid}

Response 204 No Content
Response 404: session not found or does not belong to this actor
```

### 6.5 Admin: Force Revoke Session(s)

```
POST /api/v1/admin/actors/{actor_uuid}:revoke-sessions

{
  "scope": "all | session",
  "session_uuid": "<uuid | null>",    // required if scope: session
  "reason": "<string>"               // required for audit trail
}

Response 204 No Content
Response 404: actor not found
```

---

## 7. Concurrent Session Enforcement

When `concurrent_sessions: N` is declared and a new session would exceed the limit, the oldest active session is revoked automatically:

```
New authentication succeeds
  │
  ▼ Count active sessions for actor_uuid
  │   If count >= concurrent_sessions limit:
  │     Revoke oldest session (by created_at)
  │     Trigger: concurrent_limit_exceeded
  │
  ▼ New session created
```

The evicted actor receives an `auth.session_revoked` notification if a notification service is configured with the actor's notification preferences. The event does not block the new session creation.

---

## 8. Relationship to the Credential Revocation Model

Session revocation (this document) and credential revocation (doc 31, CPX-001–CPX-012) are parallel but distinct:

| | Session Revocation | Credential Revocation |
|--|---|---|
| **What** | Bearer token / session cookie validity | API key, x509, SSH key, service account token |
| **Store** | Session Revocation Registry | Credential Revocation Registry |
| **Propagation** | Auth layer cache refresh | Message Bus → all components |
| **Actor deprovision** | All sessions revoked | All credentials revoked |
| **TTL** | Session TTL (minutes to hours) | Credential TTL (hours to years) |
| **Emergency SLA** | PT5S–PT30S | PT30S–PT5M |
| **Event** | `auth.session_revoked` | `credential.revoked` |

**AUTH-016:** On actor deprovisioning, session revocation and credential revocation are parallel operations. The deprovisioning is not acknowledged until both are confirmed complete.

---

## 9. System Policies

| Policy | Rule |
|--------|------|
| `AUTH-016` | On actor deprovisioning, session revocation and credential revocation (CPX-006) are parallel operations. Deprovisioning is not acknowledged until both complete. |
| `AUTH-017` | Session revocation must propagate to the Session Revocation Registry within the profile-governed SLA: minimal PT5M, standard PT1M, prod PT30S, fsi PT10S, sovereign PT5S. |
| `AUTH-018` | All DCM components that accept bearer tokens must check the Session Revocation Registry on each request. Cache age must not exceed the profile-governed maximum (sovereign: no cache). |
| `AUTH-019` | Emergency session revocation (security_event trigger) fires immediately with no grace period. The `auth.security_session_revoked` event has `urgency: critical` and is non-suppressable. |
| `AUTH-020` | The token introspection endpoint (`POST /api/v1/auth:introspect`) must be authenticated. Access requires an actor or service account with the `introspection` scope. |
| `AUTH-021` | When concurrent session limits are enforced, the oldest session is revoked before the new session is created. The evicted actor is notified via notification service if configured. |
| `AUTH-022` | Refresh tokens are invalidated when their parent session is revoked. A revoked refresh token returns 401 on exchange; it cannot be used to create a new session. |
