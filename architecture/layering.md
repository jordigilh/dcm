# Layering — UDLM substrate vs DCM realization

> **Implements contracts defined in UDLM**: this document names the boundary
> that the UDLM repo ([github.com/croadfeldt/udlm](https://github.com/croadfeldt/udlm))
> and this DCM repo collectively imply. The boundary rule is normative for
> both sides; the application of the rule (what lives where) is recorded in
> [`00-split-manifest.md`](00-split-manifest.md).

This document is the DCM-side perspective on the layering that justifies the
split between UDLM (substrate) and DCM (realization).

## The boundary rule

For each file or section, the test is:

> *"Could a peer of DCM, built independently, choose to do this differently
> and still be a valid realization of the same data?"*

- **Yes →** belongs in **DCM**. It's an operational/implementation choice.
- **No, it would break interop or invalidate the data →** belongs in **UDLM**.
  It's a substrate invariant.

| Concern | Layer | Why |
|---|---|---|
| State names (intent, requested, realized, discovered) | UDLM | Vocabulary every realization shares |
| Field shape at each state | UDLM | Same data, regardless of operationalization |
| Allowed transitions between states | UDLM | Invariant of the data, not a runtime choice |
| Provider response shape | UDLM | Wire contract |
| Policy input/output schemas | UDLM | Wire contract |
| Event payloads | UDLM | Wire contract that lets observers exist |
| Schema-sharing protocol | UDLM | Required for federation peers to exchange custom-type schemas |
| **The convergence loop that walks data through states** | **DCM** | Implementation choice — see [convergence-engine/overview.md](convergence-engine/overview.md) |
| **Provider invocation, retry, ordering** | **DCM** | Orchestration — see [convergence-engine/recovery-and-retry.md](convergence-engine/recovery-and-retry.md) |
| **PostgreSQL as the data store** | **DCM** | UDLM requires persistence; DCM mandates PostgreSQL specifically. See [persistence/postgres-mandate.md](persistence/postgres-mandate.md) |
| **mTLS + interaction credential for provider callback** | **DCM** | UDLM defines two-layer auth abstractly; DCM picks the specific mechanism. See [credentials-and-auth/provider-callback.md](credentials-and-auth/provider-callback.md) |
| **Specific 9-layer location hierarchy** | **DCM** | UDLM defines layered-topology contract; DCM picks Country → ... → Unit. See [topology/canonical-9-layer-hierarchy.md](topology/canonical-9-layer-hierarchy.md) |
| **Drift detection / recovery / expiration utilities** | **DCM** | Runtime concerns |
| **Control-plane components, service boundaries, APIs** | **DCM** | Deployment / runtime choices |

## Compatibility model (LOCKED)

**UDLM enforces wire-level compatibility at the data/event/contract boundary;
it does not enforce implementation portability.**

- Any system conformant to UDLM version X produces data that any other system
  conformant to the same major version can read, interpret, and exchange
  (versioning rules apply).
- Federation between peers is **literal interop**, not "architecturally similar
  systems requiring adapters."
- A peer realization's storage, internal APIs, control-plane components, and
  runtime mechanics are NOT constrained by UDLM — those are DCM-layer choices.

This is the K8s precedent: K8s API + CRDs are wire-compatible across
distributions; controllers are not portable. UDLM and DCM are in the same shape.

## Why the Higher-Order Model is deferred

A more abstract universal model likely exists above UDLM — a "manage-anything-
via-data-and-policy" pattern UDLM is a specialization of. It is intentionally
not formalized today:

- **Abstraction discipline.** UDLM is allowed to be specific enough to be
  realizable, even if that bakes in some assumptions a purer model wouldn't.
- **No pressure yet.** The higher-order model becomes worth formalizing when
  a real second realization (a non-DCM peer using UDLM) creates pressure to
  identify what is truly shared vs DCM-specific. Until then, drawing the line
  is guessing.
- **Cost asymmetry.** Premature abstraction costs more than lifting concepts
  up later when the line becomes obvious.

Treat the higher-order layer as **known to exist** and **named**, but **out of
scope for current documentation**. If a peer of DCM emerges, this is the layer
where the genuinely-shared bits will be lifted from UDLM.

## Implications for DAV (the verification framework)

DAV tests use cases against the architecture. Per this layering, that's two
distinct questions:

1. **"Does UDLM support this use case?"** — does the substrate accommodate the
   entities, states, contracts, lifecycle the UC needs?
2. **"Does DCM operationalize it correctly?"** — does the convergence loop,
   provider orchestration, and runtime actually realize it?

DAV's `spec_refs` use namespaced paths to disambiguate:
- `udlm/contracts/event-catalog.md` — substrate reference
- `dcm/architecture/convergence-engine/policy-evaluation.md` — realization reference

The two repos are independently fetchable; DAV resolves cross-repo references
during use-case evaluation.
